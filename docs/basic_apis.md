# API

## initializeAnalyticsEngine
The `initializeAnalyticsEngine` method is used for initializing SDK. This sets all required configurations and also sends system event `sdk_start` which allows it to record user.
#### Input
`init(
'XXXX',
'https://XXXX/',
);`

## capture
The `capture` method is used to record developer events. This allows you to send custom events to the server when a user is interacting with the app. For example, one custom event would be when a user adds an item to a cart.
#### Input
`capture(eventName: String, eventInfo: {})`

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
| `eventName` | `String` |  | Name of the event that you are sending |
| `eventInfo` | `Object` | Optional | You can provide some additional data to this event. There is no limitation as this is just a key-value pair send to the server. |

#### Example
```React Native
RNBlotOutSDKModule.capture('App Start', {})
```

## capturePersonal
PII (Personal Identifiable Information) events are like developer codified events that carry sensitive information related to the user.
PHI ( Protected Health Information) events are like PII, but carry userâ€™s private health information.
In Blotout managed or deployed Infrastructure, PII and PHI events data is encrypted using asymmetric encryption algorithms and provides access to authenticated users only.

#### Input
`-capturePersonal(eventName: String, eventInfo: {}, isPHI: Boolean)`

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
| `eventName` | `String` |  | Name of the event that you are sending |
| `eventInfo` | `Object` | | You can provide some additional data to this event. There is no limitation as this is just a key-value pair send to the server. |
| `isPHI` | `Boolean` | Optional | You can specify specific event type to an event|


#### Example
```React Native
RNBlotOutSDKModule.capturePersonal(
      'custom phi event',
      { emailId: 'developers@blotout.io', bloodType: 'A+' },
      true
      )
```

## getUserId
The `getUserId` method allows you to go get Blotout user id that is linked to all data that is sent to the server.

#### Output
Returns user ID as `string`.

#### Example
```React Native
RNBlotOutSDKModule.getUserId((userid: any) => console.log(userid))
```


## enable
The `enable` method allows you to enable/disable the sending of analytics data. Enabled by default.

#### Example
```React Native
RNBlotOutSDKModule.enable(true)
```
